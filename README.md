## Hi, I'm Caleb 👋
I'm a software engineer who has spent the last three years in a job where security restrictions forced me to use the bare minimum of my programming talent, and I'm looking to branch back out into some interesting new projects. 

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
Refreshing my skills with toy apps, getting up to speed on new technologies, and looking for some cool open-source projects to start contributing to. 

### ⚙️ Past projects
Available on GitHub are some of my recent skills-refreshing projects. I'll try to keep these pinned as I make them, because they're a good example of my current coding standards. 
I also have a decent amount of experience in creating Discord.js bots - some of those repos are still public. Bear in mind that these are old, very specialised to specific servers/applications, and were made when I had zero professional experience. They're probably a mess. 

### 💡 Experience
